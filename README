TextBot 0.0.2
Written and owned by Alex Wang

TextBot is a Discord bot that has many random and weird features.
The bot should be online most of the time with my free heroku server. If it's not, uh... too bad.

To invite TextBot to your Discord server, use this link:
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=788652718008827931&permissions=522304&scope=bot

All commands start with 'tb'

Commands:
    tb help - help menu with information
    tb say - says random things
    tb cringe - pings (@mention) some (cringey) person
    tb ping @user - spam pings specified user with ping speed 0.3-0.8s
    tb pog - tells you if you are poggers

The bot will print "Bot is ready, logged in as TextBox" when it is ready

If you're looking for the discord API Token, it's not here. Get your own.
